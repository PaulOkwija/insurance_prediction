    │   ├── train_data.csv                  <- Train contains the target. This is the dataset that you will use to train your model.

        │                                       dataset on which you will apply your model to.
    │   └── SampleSubmission.csv            <- This shows the submission format for this competition, with the ‘ID’ column mirroring
                                                that of Test.csv and the ‘target’ column containing your predictions. The order of the rows does not matter, but the names of the ID must be correct.
